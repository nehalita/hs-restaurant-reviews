Hi, looks like you're just surfing around.<br /> 
Going as anon allows you to view things and open/close tasks but you can't add or edit tasks. <br />
If you wan to add or edit a task, you'll need to  <a href="/signup">create an account here</a> (you can make something up)<br />
<a href="/login">If you already have an account, log in here!</a>

<form action="/anon" method="POST">
    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Log me in as Anonymous">
